        <h2>Hello, I'm Tejas K</h2>
        <p>I am from Jyothy Institute of technology pursuing CSE 7th sem and my overall CGPA is 8.9</p>
        <p>
            I’m a web developer with expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various other front-end and back-end technologies. I love building functional and visually appealing websites, focusing on user experience and efficient performance. Currently, I am pursuing my [Degree] in [Your Branch] at [Your College]. My academic journey has helped me strengthen my foundation in programming and web technologies, which I actively apply in real-world projects.

        <p>
            My passion for problem-solving and creativity drives me to continuously improve my craft. In addition to web development, I enjoy participating in coding challenges and hackathons, which further fuel my interest in technology. I aim to not only build websites but also create solutions that make a positive impact. Feel free to explore my portfolio and learn more about the projects I’ve worked on, the skills I bring to the table, and my journey in the world of web development.
